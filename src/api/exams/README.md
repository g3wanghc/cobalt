UofT Exams API
=================

This is a RESTful web API built to interface with the University of Toronto exams schedules across all three campuses. It is developed as part of a collection of open data APIs for UofT called [Cobalt](https://cobalt.qas.im).

For more information on how to use Cobalt's APIs, see the [documentation](https://cobalt.qas.im/documentation).
